        <h2>ABOUT THIS RECIPE.</h2>
        <p>There's something so special about Sheer Khurma, because of its association <br>
            with Eid. It's usually made on the morning of Eid ol Fitr, and is eaten for <br>
            breakfast after Eid namaz.
            <br>
            But you can also enjoy it any time of the year, and the good news is that <br>
            my version is super easy to make! You only need a handful of sheer khurma <br>
            ingredients, and can adapt it according to your taste.
        </p>

        <h2><u></b>INGREDIENTS YOU’LL NEED</u></b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ghee:</b>Traditionally this recipe calls for ghee, but you can also use butter as a fantastic
                substitute. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Nuts</b>Sheer khurma is typically made with a large variety of nuts and dry fruit. The good news is
                that <br>
                you can totally use whatever you have on hand or enjoy. I used pistachios, cashews, and almonds.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Vermicelli:</b>Use nylon vermicelli for the best results. This is typically longer and thinner <br>
                than standard vermicelli. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Milk:</b>This is a rich dessert, and I highly recommend you use whole milk for the best results. <br>
                Using milk with low fat content will result in a less creamy result. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>cardamom pods:</b> If you don’t have any on hand, you can substitute with cardamom powder. <br>
                The flavor is very potent, so use sparingly. A pinch of the powder should be enough. </li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your liking.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Evaporated Milk: </b>This is an optional ingredient, but adds a lot of richness to the sheer <br>
                khurma. Once you try it this way, you’ll never go back! </li>
        </ul>
